title: "Famo.us Front End Containers"
description: "A new paradigm being introduced by Famo.us to web development is Front-End Containerization similar to backend containers like Docker. These can be served & shared via the new service platform Famo.us is releasing known as The Hub. Instead of building monolithic single-page apps with difficult-to-manage and difficult-to-deploy code bases, developers can build discrete Famo.us components that can be injected (containerized) into any new or existing applications.  These containers can be administered (content, configuration, version management) by non-coding folks, so you could think of it a bit like a \"distributed Wordpress,\" deployed anywhere to native or web applications, but managed through a singular place known as The Hub."
