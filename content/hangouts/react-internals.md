React: a robust functional view layer.

View code and templating are combined as JavaScript.

In JavaScript you create a virtual DOM, react diffs
changes between the last virtual DOM and the next,
mutating the real DOM only as necessary to reflect
the changes. This has huge implications for cognitive
overhead as well as performance.

We are going to enter the source where that virtual
DOM gets created using calls to
`React.DOM[element](attributes, contents)`

Example usage

```JavaScript

var React = require('react')
  , d = React.DOM // Alias React.DOM for easier typing

var vDom =
  d.div({className: 'conainer'}
    , d.div({className: 'contents'},
      { start: d.p({}, 'Foo, bar, baz')
      , middle: d.a({href: 'http://github.com'}, 'github')
      , end: d.p({}, ['Weee', 'eeeeeee', 'eeee'])
      }
    )
  )

console.log(JSON.stringify(vDom, null, 2))

```
